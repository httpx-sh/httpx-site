[IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2 EAP 5](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2022/06/intellij-idea-2022-2-eap-5/#Support_for_GraphQL_endpoints_in_the_HTTP_Client) has GraphQL support in the HTTP client,
and schema extension is supported too. 

### GraphQL over WebSocket

```
GRAPHQL ws://localhost:8080/graphql
Content-Type: application/graphql

subscription demo{ greetings }
```

### GraphQL over RSocket

Current schemas for RSocket are:  rsocket for tcp, rsocketws for WS and rsocketwss for WSS.

```
GRAPHQL rsocketws://localhost:8080/rsocket/graphql

query demo {
    bookById(id: "book-1") {
        id
        name
        pageCount
        author {
            firstName
            lastName
        }
    }
}
```

You should install [RSocket JetBrains plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18195-rsocket-requests-in-http-client) first to try GraphQL over RSocket with JetBrains IDE.
